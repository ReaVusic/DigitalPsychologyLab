      <h2>Theoretical background</h2>
      <p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects a significant portion of the population. It
        is characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep, resulting in poor sleep quality and
        daytime impairment. Insomnia can have negative impacts on various aspects of an
        individual's life, such as work productivity, mental health, and overall quality of life.
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), have been shown
        to be effective in treating insomnia. However, access to these interventions can be limited
        due to factors such as cost, availability, and stigma associated with seeking mental health
        treatment. EHealth-based interventions, which deliver these interventions through digital
        platforms such as websites or mobile apps, have the potential to increase access to
        treatment and reduce barriers to care.

        <h4>1.	What is this study about?</h4>
        <p>The study focuses on eHealth-based psychosocial interventions, which are interventions delivered via digital technologies such as mobile apps, online platforms, or telehealth. The authors aim to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in improving sleep outcomes and other outcomes such as depression and anxiety.
            <br>
            To conduct their analysis, the authors conducted a comprehensive search of relevant databases and identified 15 RCTs that met their inclusion criteria. They then conducted a meta-analysis of the data from these trials to determine the overall effect of eHealth-based interventions on sleep outcomes.
            The study found that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions were effective in improving sleep outcomes among adults with insomnia. The authors noted that these interventions could be a viable alternative to traditional face-to-face interventions, especially for individuals who have limited access to in-person treatment or prefer the convenience of accessing treatment from their own homes.
            <br>
            Overall, the study provides important insights into the potential of eHealth-based interventions for improving sleep outcomes among adults with insomnia and highlights the need for further research in this area.

          <h4>	2.	What are the results of the study?</h4>
        <p>The study found that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for adults with insomnia are effective in improving sleep outcomes. Specifically, the interventions were found to be associated with significant improvements in sleep quality, sleep duration, and insomnia severity. The study also identified several factors that may moderate the effectiveness of these interventions, including the type of intervention, the delivery format, and the level of therapist involvement.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>3.	Quality of the meta-analysis?</h4>
          <p>The meta-analysis was conducted according to rigorous standards and included a comprehensive search of multiple databases. The study used appropriate statistical methods to synthesize the data from the included studies, and the authors conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings. Overall, the quality of the meta-analysis is considered to be high.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>4.	Conclusion for research and relevant stakeholders </h4>
        <p>The study provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for adults with insomnia. These interventions may be particularly beneficial for individuals who have limited access to traditional face-to-face interventions or who prefer the convenience and flexibility of online interventions. The study suggests that eHealth-based interventions should be considered as a viable treatment option for adults with insomnia, and that further research is needed to identify the most effective delivery formats and to understand the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of these interventions.
