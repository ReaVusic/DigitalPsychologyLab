      <h2>Theoretical background</h2>
      <p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects a significant portion of the population. It
        is characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep, resulting in poor sleep quality and
        daytime impairment. Insomnia can have negative impacts on various aspects of an
        individual's life, such as work productivity, mental health, and overall quality of life.
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), have been shown
        to be effective in treating insomnia. However, access to these interventions can be limited
        due to factors such as cost, availability, and stigma associated with seeking mental health
        treatment. EHealth-based interventions, which deliver these interventions through digital
        platforms such as websites or mobile apps, have the potential to increase access to
        treatment and reduce barriers to care.

        <h4>1.	What is this study about?</h4>
        <p>The study focuses on eHealth-based psychosocial interventions, which are interventions delivered via digital technologies such as mobile apps, online platforms, or telehealth. The authors aim to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in improving sleep outcomes and other outcomes such as depression and anxiety.
            <br>
            To conduct their analysis, the authors conducted a comprehensive search of relevant databases and identified 37 RCTs that met their inclusion criteria. They then conducted a meta-analysis of the data from these trials to determine the overall effect of eHealth-based interventions on sleep outcomes.
            The study found that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions were effective in improving sleep outcomes among adults with insomnia. The authors noted that these interventions could be a viable alternative to traditional face-to-face interventions, especially for individuals who have limited access to in-person treatment or prefer the convenience of accessing treatment from their own homes.
            <br>
            Overall, the study provides important insights into the potential of eHealth-based interventions for improving sleep outcomes among adults with insomnia and highlights the need for further research in this area.

          <h4>	2.	What are the results of the study?</h4>
        <p>The study found that eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for adults with insomnia are effective in improving sleep outcomes. Specifically, the interventions were found to be associated with significant improvements in sleep quality, sleep duration, and insomnia severity. The study also identified several factors that may moderate the effectiveness of these interventions, including the type of intervention, the delivery format, and the level of therapist involvement.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>3.	Quality of the meta-analysis?</h4>
          <p>The meta-analysis was conducted according to rigorous standards and included a comprehensive search of multiple databases. The study used appropriate statistical methods to synthesize the data from the included studies, and the authors conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings. Overall, the quality of the meta-analysis is considered to be high.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>4.	Conclusion for research and relevant stakeholders </h4>
        <p>The study provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for adults with insomnia. These interventions may be particularly beneficial for individuals who have limited access to traditional face-to-face interventions or who prefer the convenience and flexibility of online interventions. The study suggests that eHealth-based interventions should be considered as a viable treatment option for adults with insomnia, and that further research is needed to identify the most effective delivery formats and to understand the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of these interventions.

        <h2>Study Example</h4>
        <h5 align="justify">The study by Espie and colleagues (2012)  explores the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in treating persistent insomnia disorder. The study involved 164 participants who met the criteria for persistent Insomnia Disorder, who were randomized into three groups: online CBT, online imagery relief therapy (IRT: placebo), and treatment as usual (TAU). Major assessments were at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up eight weeks later. The CBT program comprised a fully automated media-rich web application, driven dynamically by baseline, adherence, performance, and progress data. Participants received 6 weekly sessions delivered by an animated “virtual therapist” (The Prof) that covered behavioral and cognitive strategies, as well as additional relaxation strategies and advice on lifestyle and bedroom factors.IRT was delivered using the same application platform as CBT, but without any known active therapeutic ingredient. The trial found that CBT resulted in significant improvements in sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time compared to IRT and TAU. Effect sizes were observed for CBT relative to IRT and TAU. These effects remained robust at follow-up. SOL (sleep onset latency) was reduced by 56% (compared to 5% and 17% in IRT and TAU), and WASO (wake time after sleep onset) was reduced by 63% (compared to 29% in IRT and a 4% increase in TAU). Global sleep-wake function, assessed by the Sleep Condition Indicator, similarly favored CBT, and clinical significance of findings was confirmed by the proportion of patients achieving SE (sleep efficiency) values > 85% (post-treatment: 55% [CBT] v. 17.3% [IRT] v. 7.8% [TAU]; follow-up: 42% [CBT] v. 15% [IRT] v. 3.9% [TAU]), as well as improvements in daytime functioning. It also found that CBT was more effective in reducing the severity of symptoms, increasing treatment satisfaction, and reducing negative consequences than IRT and TAU. The study concludes that online CBT is a promising treatment for persistent insomnia disorder, which can be delivered cost-effectively and widely.</h5>

       <h5 align="justify">McCurry and co-authors (2016) investigated the effectiveness of telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) compared to menopause education control (MEC) in treating insomnia symptoms related to menopause in primary and women's specialty care settings. The study included 106 women aged 40-65 years who were peri- or postmenopausal, reported at least moderate insomnia symptoms (ISI>12), and had two or more daily hot flashes.
        During the 8-week intervention period and the 24-week follow-up, six telephone sessions of either CBT-I or MEC were conducted. All participants submitted weekly electronic sleep diaries and received educational materials specific to their group. The primary outcome was the ISI score, and the secondary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
        From baseline to 8 weeks, the ISI score decreased by 9.9 points in the CBT-I group and 4.7 points in the MEC group (P<0.001). The PSQI score decreased by 4.0 points in the CBT-I group and 1.4 points in the MEC group (P<0.001). Significant group differences were maintained at 24 weeks. At 8 and 24 weeks, 70% and 84% of women in the CBT-I group had ISI scores in the no-insomnia range, compared to 24% and 43% of women in the MEC group, respectively. Women in the CBT-I group also had greater improvements in diary-reported sleep latency, wake time, and sleep efficiency. There were no differences between groups in daily hot flash frequency, but hot flash interference was significantly (p=0.03) reduced at 8 and 24 weeks for the CBT-I group compared to the MEC group. Telephone-delivered CBT-I was effective in improving sleep in peri- and postmenopausal women with insomnia and hot flashes.</h5>
